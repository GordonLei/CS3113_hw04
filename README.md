Shoot by pressing spacebar. The "bullet" / laser shoots in the direction you are walking. By default it will shoot to the right if you are standing still.

3 types of enemies, one that stays still until you get close to it, one that walks randomly, and one that will home toward you. For every enemy type, if you go close to it, they will start chasing you. If you get touched by one of them, you lose.
